    #### Description:

    Malaysia is one of the southeast asian countries that faces issues with land flood almost every year. Towards the end of the year, the moonsoon season would shower heavy rainfall on different areas of the country. As the water builds up overtime and exceeds the capacity of the irrigation and drainage system, the excess water will flow onto residential areas. Simlarly, deforestation is also another crucial factor that poses a serious risk of land flood occurance. Malaysia have lost about 30% of its tree cover from the year 2000 to 2022, which signifies a critical threat to not only rural communities, but also urban inhabitants. The 2021-2022 Malaysian Flood disaster had affected more than 125,000 people and displaced more than 71,000 residents. It is clear that land flood is a significant issue that threatens the livelihood of local communities in Malaysia.

    MYFloodAlert is a program that was created to help address the flood issue by enabling communities to take proactive measures and mitigate the impact of floods effectively. Real-time data is used to provide timely warnings regarding rising water level, and other information such as current water level, water level trend, rainfall status, as well as water level condition. All of which are essential informations that can assist local communities about changing flood situations. MYFloodAlert uses real-time data from Flood Warning API (https://developer.data.gov.my/realtime-api/flood-warning#flood-warning-api-endpoint) that provides data that is updated every 15-minutes on water levels and flood warnings at monitoring stations around the country. These data are collected by the Malaysian Department of Irrigation and Drainage, ensuring its accuracy and reliability.

    When running the program, users will be welcomed by MYFloodAlert. Users then may navigate and select the state of their choice from the list of 15 states. After selecting the state, a list of districts from the selected state will be displayed. The number of districts depends on the selected state. Users is required to choose one of the districts, and then a list of main basins within the district will be displayed. Upon selecting the main basin, a subsequent list of related sub-basins will be presented. To go back, simply input "b" and the terminal will display the previous list to be selected. Moreover, it is important to note that main basins encompass a larger river systems within the chosen district, comprising numerous water streams. On the other hand, sub-basins are smaller divisions within these main basins, often comprising individual rivers or smaller streams that contribute to the larger watershed. After the user has chosen the sub-basin, the program retrieves specific details such as the current water level, normal and danger water levels, and the water level trend and condition, as well as the rainfall status. If the current water level, water level trend, as well as water level condition indicate a potential danger and reaching threatening levels, the text will be displayed in red, alerting users to the critical situation. This information, along with the last update timestamp, provides a comprehensive snapshot of the sub-basin's current water status and alerts users to any potential risks or changes in water levels.

    In terms of design and architecture of this program, there were many challenges faced. One challenge is understanding and integrating with the data source/API. In this case, fetching data from "https://api.data.gov.my/flood-warning" is crucial. Understanding the data structure, frequency of updates, and handling missing datas are key challenges in the initial stage. Secondly, creating a user-friendly interface that allows users to navigate through multiple levels of information seamlessly is another challenge. The design must prioritize clarity. Ensuring that the prompts are both visually appealing and comprehensible is paramount. Handling user inputs, and displaying information in a readable format are all important aspects. The "return back" functionality is a critical component, enabling users to backtrack or retrace their steps seamlessly within the application. This ensures users can effortlessly navigate through the various levels of data without feeling constrained or lost within the interface. Furthermore, deciding on the hierarchical structure and navigation flow within the application is crucial. Multi-level structure (states -> districts -> main basins -> sub-basins) was chosen, and it might get complex for users to navigate if not designed properly. Maintaining a clear and intuitive pathway for users to navigate through these tiers requires careful consideration of information architecture and user experience design to prevent users from feeling lost or disoriented within the application's hierarchy. As for the limitations of this project, users are required to know about the basins and sub-basins around them to benefit from flood level information within their area. This could limit the program's usefulness for those unfamiliar with nearby basins and sub-basins. Looking ahead, an enhancement could involve the program detecting users' current location and providing relevant information based on their closest basins and sub-basins. It would significantly improve accessibility and usability for a wider range of users, enhancing the efficiency of monitoring floods and reacting to them.

    In reflection, my journey through CS50P has been incredibly enlightening, particularly through the final project which provided invaluable lessons. Prior to this course, I lacked any programming background, making this experience exceptionally fulfilling. My gratitude extends to Dr. Malan and the entire CS50 team for coordinating such an exceptional learning environment. CS50P has equipped me with a wealth of Python knowledge, igniting a desire to delve deeper into this language and explore the areas that I have yet to explore. Python served as a solid introduction to the programming landscape, and my aspirations extend toward exploring languages like Solidity, which is used in the world of blockchain. Overall, I take pride in the progress I've made in programming and the journey has been a fulfilling blend of challenges, learning experiences, and rewarding accomplishments. Driven by curiosity, my commitment remains persistent as I explore various aspects of the programming realm, constantly pushing the boundaries of my learning journey.
